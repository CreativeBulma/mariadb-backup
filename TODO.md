# TODO List for maria_db_backup #
-----
        (Updated 2018-04-06)

## Bug to Fix ##

## Features to Add ##

* Encrypt and Compress to a Single File

* Support incremental backups

* Support deleting older versions of backups

* Option to run without output unless an error occurs

## Associated Things to Do ##

* Create a Restore Script

## Other ##

* I *could* add some command-line switches for debugging and overriding
  the options in /etc/default/mariabackup ... but that seems to add a
  lot of cruft to put into a cron script.
